There are special files that tell the web server certain things about how it should function:

.nocgi - will disable CGI in that directory,
.private - will make the directory forbidden,
.nolist - will make the directory listing forbidden.

Their existence alone activates them. The server does not check what is inside them, so they should preferably be created using the UNIX 'touch' command.
